## Career history

## Hobbies

In a previous life I was an avid backpacker. Somewhere along the line I stopped backpacking and I missed it. I recently got back into it.

I am also a maker. I joined a makerspace in Broomfield so that I could have time and tools to work on personal projects. I'm now the vice president of the space.
